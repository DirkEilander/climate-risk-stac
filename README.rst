##  Introduction
In this repository, a metadata catalog of datasets for climate risk assessments (CRA) is assembled, 
implemented in the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification and browsable in the STAC browser. 

The current version of the catalog is structured along the three risk drivers hazard, exposure, and vulnerability, 
and distinguishes climate processes (i.e. hazards) and socioeconomic processes (i.e. exposure and vulnerability) datasets.
