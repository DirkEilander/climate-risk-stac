# Introduction

In this repository, a metadata catalog of datasets for climate risk assessments (CRA) is assembled, 
implemented in the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification and browsable in the STAC browser. 

STAC Browser: 
`explore the catalog <https://radiantearth.github.io/stac-browser/#/external/raw.githubusercontent.com/DirkEilander/climate-risk-stac/main/stac/catalog.json>`_


The current version of the catalog includes hazard, exposure and vulnerbility datasets, which are grouped into climate processes (i.e. hazards) and socioeconomic processes (i.e. exposure and vulnerability).
