    "description": "The Global 1-km Downscaled Population Base Year and Projection Grids Based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, Revision 01, data set consists of global urban, rural, and total populaton for the base year 2000, and population projections at ten-year intervals for 2010-2100 at a resolution of 1-km (about 30 arc-seconds), consistent both quantitatively and qualitatively with the SSPs. This 1-km data set is a downscaled version of the one-eighth degree (7.5 arc-minutes) data published in Jones and O'Neill (2016).",
