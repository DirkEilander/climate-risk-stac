    "description": "This global dataset represents the gross domestic production (GDP) of each grid cell. GDP is given in 2011 international US dollars. The data is derived from GDP per capita (PPP) which is multiplied by gridded population data HYDE 3.2 (the years of population data not available (1991-1999) were linearly interpolated at grid scale based on data from years 1990 and 2000). Dataset has global extent at 5 arc-min resolution for the 26-year period of 1990-2015. Detail description is given in a linked article and metadata is provided as an attribute in the NetCDF file itself.",
