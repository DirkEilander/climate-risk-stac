    "description": "HDI is a composite index of average achievement in key dimensions of human development (dimensionless indicator between 0 and 1). This index is based on method introduced 2010 and updated 2011. The subnational data for HDI were collected from multiple national-level datasets, and national-level HDI was collected from UNDP. Years with missing data were interpolated over time thin plate spines, assuming smooth trend over time. The dataset has a global extent at 5 arc-min resolution, and the annual data is available for each year over 1990-2015. HDI sub-national data covers 39 countries and 66% of global population in 2015.",
