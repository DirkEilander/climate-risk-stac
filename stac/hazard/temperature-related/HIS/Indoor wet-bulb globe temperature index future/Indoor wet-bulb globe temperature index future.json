    "description": "Indoor wet-bulb globe temperature is a heat stress indicator that is calculated as weighted mean of wet-bulb temperature, globe temperature, and daily maximum temperature. In the present dataset, the influence of solar radiation and wind speed is not considered and wet-bulb globe temperature is calculated as weighted mean of wet-bulb temperature and daily maximum temperature (neglecting globe temperature). It thus represents indoor conditions.",
