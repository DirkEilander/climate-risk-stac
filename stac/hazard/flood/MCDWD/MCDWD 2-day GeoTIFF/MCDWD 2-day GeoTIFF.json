    "description": "The MODIS/Aqua+Terra Global Flood Product L3 Near Real Time (NRT) 250m 2-day GeoTIFF Product (MCDWD_L3_F2_NRT) (beta) provides maps of flooding globally. The Global Flood product is provided over 3 compositing periods (1-day, 2-day, and 3-day) to minimize the impact of clouds and more rigorously identify flood water (the best composite will depend on the cloudiness for a particular event). The MCDWD_L3_F2_NRT is 2-day product which is generated from current and previous day\u2019s data.",
